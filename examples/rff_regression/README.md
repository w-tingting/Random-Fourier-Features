Random Fourier Features: Sample RFF Regression
====

This python script provides an example for regression with random fourier features.
Our module for random fourier features (PyRFFF.py) needs scikit-learn as a backend of SVM solver therefore you need to install scikit-learn.


## Usage

If you don't have scikit-learn, please run the following as root to install it:

```console
$ pip3 install scikit-learn
```

You can run the example code by the following command:

```console
$ python3 sample_rff_regression.py
```

## Results of Regression with RFF

The following figure shows a regression results for the function y = sin(x^2) with RFF where dimension of RFF is 16.
